TODO
As can be seen, there is a lot to do. * indicates important. Some of these things may not be done by publication. Maybe the crossbar model can be its own smaller publication, or an ArXiv paper. 

(1) Finish fig5.py
  * solve training issue for rnn-odes for interpolation
  * More epochs for training figure
  - Prettify figures, get the right fonts, make sure axes are right size, whatever.
(2) Write fig6.py models and outputs
  * Spiral datasets
  * caption
  * noise plots
(3) Actual science questions
  * effects of different solvers
  * Variability impact on node vs convential
  * Figure out what NODE-RNNs are used for in the original paper, some kind of gaussian mixture model.
  - energy efficiency
  - effect of time mesh size
  * Characterize data movement
(4) write more networks with crossbar integration
  - Convolutions
  - Avg Pooling
  - More ODE Solvers
(5) Improve crossbar circuit solver
  * Mapping for addition on the crossbar (may be involved due to scaling)
  - Write auto magic scaling number tuning routine
  - fit memristor data to VTEAM model, get parameters
  - Integrate VTEAM python model into crossbar, write iterative circuit solver (basic euler's method?)
  - Expose input / output resistances and voltages to user, this allows for ADC and DAC models later
  - Implement CMOS resistance
  - Improve mapping algorithm, fun little project on optimal rectangle packing
  - General prettification, move stuff into different files
  - improve neanderthal inverse hash on inverse matrices
  - Parallelize stuff (tiles inputs can be multiplied by inverses in parallel, GPU support, etc.)
(6) Documentation
  - Explain how mapping works, how it can be implemented into C code
  - General docs stuff
(7) Repository
  - use git issues instead of these notes lol
  - put in adjoint method code from forever ago
  - put in old solvers, etc.
