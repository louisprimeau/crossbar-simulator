TODO
* indicates important

(1) fix crossbar bad prediction
(2) Finish fig5.py
  * solve training issue for rnn-odes for interpolation
  * Heatmaps of weights
  - Prettify figures, get the right fonts, make sure axes are right size, whatever.
(3) merge crossbar/crossbar_viability.py into crossbar/crossbar.py and test
(4) Write fig6.py models and outputs
  * Spiral datasets
  * caption
  * noise plots
(5) write more networks with crossbar integration
  - Convolutions
  - Avg Pooling
  - More ODE Solvers
(6) Improve crossbar circuit solver
  * Mapping for addition on the crossbar (may be involved due to scaling)
  - Write auto magic scaling number tuning routine
  - fit memristor data to VTEAM model, get parameters
  - Integrate VTEAM python model into crossbar, write iterative circuit solver (basic euler's method?)
  - Expose input / output resistances and voltages to user, this allows for ADC and DAC models later
  - Implement CMOS resistance
  - Improve mapping algorithm, fun little project on optimal rectangle packing
  - General prettification, move stuff into different files
  - improve neanderthal inverse hash on inverse matrices
  - Parallelize stuff (tiles inputs can be multiplied by inverses in parallel, GPU support, etc.)
(7) Documentation
  - Explain how mapping works, how it can be implemented into C code
  - General docs stuff
