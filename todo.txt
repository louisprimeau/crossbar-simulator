TODO
Sort of in order:

(1) resolve package stuff for new split of files from cbroutines
(2) fix crossbar bad prediction
(3) Finish fig5.py
  - solve training issue for rnn-odes for interpolation
  - Heatmaps of weights
(4) merge crossbar/crossbar_viability.py into crossbar/crossbar.py and test
(5) Write fig6.py models and outputs
  - Spiral datasets
  - caption
  - noise plots
(6) fit memristor data to matlab model, get parameters
  - Integrate memristor python model into crossbar
    - Write iterative circuit solver (basic euler's method?)
